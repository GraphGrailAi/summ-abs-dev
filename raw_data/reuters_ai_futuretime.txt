Reuters Becomes The First News Agency to Use AI For Sport Video Reports
Reuters News Agency, in cooperation with AI company Synthesia, has launched the “world’s first automated presenter-led video sport report”, reads company press release from February 7.

Reuters and Synthesia have created a “virtual” presenter based on actual human presenter, using AI technology. Artificial sports commentator delivers match summaries, “without any human scripting, editing or production”, explains the press release.

According to Nick Cohen, global head of product, core news services at Reuters, this project, being just a prototype, paths the way for further research on implementing AI in journalism: 

“This kind of prototyping is helping us to understand how AI and synthetic media can be combined with our real-time feeds of photography and reporting to create whole new kinds of products and services”

Synthesia’s CEO and co-founder Victor Riparbelli shares the view that AI technologies are the future in the industry:

“AI-generated content will be a cornerstone of the media landscape in the coming decade and we are pleased to be at the forefront of developing new products and experience alongside industry leaders such as Reuters”

Future Time is not behind the global trend. Future Time’s AI contributor Marat 3.0 is expected to deliver his first article on technology and art already this week. Stay tuned!
